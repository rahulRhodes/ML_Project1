# setup.py is the build script for your Python project.

# It tells tools like pip and setuptools:

# What your project is called

# What version it is

# Who wrote it

# What dependencies it needs

# What Python packages are included

# How to install it

# Itâ€™s especially important if:

# You want to distribute your project (e.g. on PyPI)

# You want to re-use your code as a module

# You want to maintain it like a professional project
